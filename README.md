## About The Project

Translation is an activity, a product, and a process. As an activity, translation is a complex act that requires close reading of a text in the source language, understanding its meaning, and creating an equivalent text in the target language. Language Translation is the process of conveying a written source language text clearly, completely, accurately, and appropriately in a target language. Translation allows information to be transferred across languages, expanding the accessibility of the information. We then wrote about how we decided to simplify the process to make it easier for the common citizen to utilize the power of APIâ€™s provided by big multinational cooperation and make a software for the people.

This translator uses Microsoft API and Python, which can translate from Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text.
